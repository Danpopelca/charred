          <p class="lead mb-4">
            In the summer of 1967, a young chef named George Messick opened the
            doors to a small neighborhood grill with nothing more than an old
            charcoal pit, a few cast-iron pans, and an obsession for fire-kissed
            flavor. He had no investors, no marketing team, and no secret recipe
            — just calloused hands, a sharp blade, and a stubborn belief that
            food cooked over open flame tastes better.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The original Charred 1967 was no more than six tables tucked behind
            a butcher shop. Smoke would rise from the back alley grill each
            evening, drawing curious neighbors with the scent of sizzling steak
            and spiced wood. George didn’t talk much — he let the food speak.
            Every night, he trimmed his cuts by hand, seasoned them with
            instinct, and cooked them by feel, never time. Guests would sip
            lemonade or bring their own wine, sharing stories while George
            plated with quiet focus and firelight on his apron.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Word spread. One table turned to ten. Locals began calling it “the
            fire place” — not for warmth, but for the way it lit up the block
            with flavor. Charred 1967 wasn’t about fancy ingredients or Michelin
            stars. It was about smoke, simplicity, and soul. George believed
            that if he treated every steak like it was for his own family,
            people would come back. They did.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            For over five decades, that same spirit has stayed lit. Passed down
            to the next generation, refined through new techniques, but still
            grounded in the same purpose: honest food, bold flame, and true
            hospitality. Today, Charred 1967 stands as a tribute to that
            original fire — the one that never needed a gas line to keep
            burning.

            What began as a humble neighborhood grill has grown into a modern
            fine-dining experience — without losing its soul. Today, Charred
            1967 is run by the same family, now led by Executive Chef Carl
            Messick, who continues to honor his father's fire-born philosophy
            with every plate served.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Our focus is simple: local, fresh, uncompromising ingredients. Every
            piece of produce is sourced from nearby farms. Every cut of meat is
            hand-selected and butchered in-house. We work closely with New
            Jersey and Pennsylvania purveyors to bring you seafood caught that
            same morning, herbs picked that same hour, and wines from vineyards
            we know by name.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Our kitchen burns with the same respect for fire as it did in 1967 —
            no shortcuts, no gas lines, just natural charcoal and a relentless
            commitment to flavor. From dry-aged ribeyes to seasonal vegetables
            roasted to perfection, we craft each dish with care, precision, and
            pride.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Charred 1967 isn't just a restaurant. It's a legacy of flame,
            flavor, and family — and we're proud to share that legacy with every
            guest who walks through our doors.
